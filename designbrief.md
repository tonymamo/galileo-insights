# Website design brief

1. Background

[Short paragraph with background about your organisation. State your mission in a single sentence if you can and describe what sort of organisation you are and the field you work in.]

2. Objectives

[Keep it short and just mention your key performance indicators (KPIs). No need to include a lengthy audit or lots of current performance statistics. These are important but not at this stage in the process.]

3. Reason for planning a redesign

[Explain why you have decided that now is the time to overhaul your website. Indicate the main shortcomings of your existing website.]

4. Current website

[Describe your current technical setup, including the software or platforms that you use]

5. Other systems you use

[Try to cover all systems that might be relevant including email marketing (e.g. Mailchimp), accounting (e.g. Xero), database (e.g. RaisersEdge), etc. Explain whether you expect these to interface with your website and if so, to what extent.]

6. Timescale

[Explain any particular circumstances driving the timeline. Resist the temptation to dictate a specific timeline if you are just keen to get something &#39;as soon as possible&#39;. In that case, just make it clear that you want suppliers to set out their typical timelines.]

7. Content

[Explain what types of content you publish, and how often. This might include pages, blog posts, events, resources, stories etc.]

8. Transactional functionality

[Be as explicit as you can about the actions you want your users to be able to take. Focus on your needs, try to avoid prescribing specific solutions as the supplier may have alternative ideas.]

9. Your budget

[Always try to set out a rough budget. This avoids a lot of wasted time speaking with suppliers you can&#39;t afford.]

10. Staff resources and decision making

[Describe your team and their stake in the website redesign project.]

11. Understanding of best-practices

[Research and describe what you think you need with respect to accessibility, SEO, security and mobile optimisation. The supplier will probably include these as standard but it&#39;s good to have this included in your brief.]

12. Your questions

[List the key information you want in response from suppliers. Don&#39;t prescribe the exact format in which they should reply because the best suppliers will have their own proposal templates.]

Please provide information on:

- The technology you use (open source or SaaS, eg. Wordpress or Squarespace)
- Example case studies using the above technology
- Hosting, support, maintenance and feature updates
- Total cost of ownership including setup and ongoing costs
- Your approach to data protection
- Who will lead the project
- What the project process looks like and how long it normally takes
- Your backup and emergency access procedures
- Contract length and any other commitments
- What happens if we want to cancel and/or export our data
- How we access training and support and any limitations within quoted prices
- How much control we will have over content management

13. Contact details and timeframe

[Include the contact details of the person to get in touch with regarding this brief. Be clear about when you want to hear back from people.]
